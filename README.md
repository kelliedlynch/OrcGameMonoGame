# OrcGameMonoGame

A Dwarf Fortress-like game built using the MonoGame framework. This is a second attempt at [this project](https://github.com/kelliedlynch/orc_game), which I stopped working on once I encountered too many bugs and limitations in the Godot engine. Currently I'm in the process of building a dynamic GOAP (Goal-Oriented Action Planning) system to drive creatures' behavior.

Code will probably be somewhat messy, because I'm also using this to teach myself C#.
